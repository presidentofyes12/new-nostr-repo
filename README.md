### Development Phase: Implementation and Testing

2. **Task Breakdown**:
   - **Version Controll and  Development**:
     - Implement core components such as version control, branching, merging, and history management.
     - Develop storage backend for storing and retrieving versions and branches.
     - Implement delta encoding, compression, and encryption for efficient storage and data security.
   - **Frontend Development**:
     - Develop user interface components for interacting with the AEVC library.
     - Design user-friendly commands and views for version control operations.
   - **Blockchain Integration**:
     - Integrate with Nostr for posting hashed data to the blockchain.
     - Implement mechanisms for retrieving and verifying hashes from the blockchain.
   - **Cryptography Implementation**:
     - Implement encryption, signing, and key exchange functionalities using secure cryptographic algorithms.
     - Ensure the AEVC library's cryptographic components adhere to best practices and standards.
   - **Network Communication**:
     - Develop peer-to-peer communication protocol using Nostr or other decentralized communication protocols.
     - Implement methods for connecting, subscribing to events, publishing events, and requesting events.
   - **Quality Assurance and Testing**:
     - Develop comprehensive unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests for each component.
     - Conduct thorough testing for various scenarios, edge cases, and potential failure points.
     - Establish a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for automated testing and deployment.

4. **Resource Allocation**:
   - Allocate appropriate resources to each development task based on complexity and priority.
   - Ensure effective communication and collaboration among team members to maximize productivity.
   - Provide necessary support and guidance to team members throughout the development process.

5. **Documentation and Training**:
   - Develop comprehensive documentation for the AEVC library, including usage guidelines, tutorials, and API references.
   - Conduct training sessions for developers to familiarize them with the AEVC library and its usage.
 
7. **Maintenance and Support**:
   - Establish a plan for ongoing maintenance and support of the AEVC library post-launch.
   - Regularly release updates, bug fixes, and security patches to ensure the stability and security of the library.
   - Provide channels for users to seek assistance and report issues, fostering a supportive and collaborative environment within the developer community.

By following this plan, We can ensure the successful implementation and testing of the AEVC library, paving the way for its integration into your decentralized social media platform.
